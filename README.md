<h1>Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree:Logs Analysis</h1>

This is the First Project in the Full Stack Web Development Nanodegree course that is offered in Udacity. We are given a large database 
and are instructed to run complex sql queries to draw conclusions based on the data. This comes
in the form of an internal reporting tool that will use the information from the database to 
answer several questions such as "Who are the top authors?" and "What are the top 3 articles?"
